Use summary statistics, visualization or other analytical means to explain your argumentation - it's important that you coherently explain, why you deem certain factors important and why some might be considered more important than others
You can for example use ipython (jupyter) notebooks, BI visualization tools (Tableau, Power BI, Excel) or such
